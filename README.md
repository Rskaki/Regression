# REGRESSION LINÃ‰AIRE
In 2020, an international study was conducted in more than 90 countries to obtain information on the growth curves of girls and boys aged 5 to 19 years. 
The methodology of this study is as follows: for each country, 200 doctors (general practitioners or pediatricians, in hospitals or in private practice) were randomly selected throughout the territory. Each physician then randomly selected 20 patients (10 of each sex) aged 5 to 19 years, and recorded their age and height. The age was recorded by all practitioners with a rounding of 1 digit after the decimal point (in decimal years), and the height with a rounding of 1 digit after the decimal point (in cm). 

For each country in the study, the age and height of 4000 children (2000 of each sex) were available
